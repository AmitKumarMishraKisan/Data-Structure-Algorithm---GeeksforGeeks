Given a Singly Linked List of size N. The task is to complete the function areIdentical(), which checks whether two linked list are identical or not. Two Linked Lists are identical when they have same data and arrangement of data is also same.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input contains length of linked lists N and M and next line contains elements of the linked lists.

Output:
For each test the output will be 'Identical' if two list are identical else 'Not identical'.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function areIdentical() which takes head of both linked lists as arguments and returns True or False.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 103

Example:
Input:
2
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
4
99 59 42 20
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
Not identical
Identical

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Each element of first linked list is not equal to each elements of second linked list in the same order.
Testcase 2: Each element of first linked list is equal to each elements of second linked list in the same order.
