Given a vector of N positive integers. Your task is to print the vector elements in reverse order.

Hint: You may use rbegin and rend.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcase, T. For each testcase, first line of input contains N, size of vector. Next line contains N elements seperated by space.

Output:
For each testcase, print the vector elements in reverse order.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= V[i] <= 1012

User Task:
Your task is to complete the function reverseIterator() which accepts it1 and it2 as two parameters and prints the vector elements in reverse order.

Example:
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output:
5 4 3 2 1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Vector elements in reverse order are as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
